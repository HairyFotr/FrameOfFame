This sample document presents an approach to typesetting your BSc thesis using
\LaTeX. A proper abstract should contain around 100 words which makes this one
way too short. A good abstract contains: (1) a short description of the
tackled problem, (2) a short description of your approach to solving the
problem, and (3) (the most successful) result or contribution in your thesis.
